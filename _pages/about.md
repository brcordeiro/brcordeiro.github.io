Over the years, I have worn different hats in data teams, from data analyst to data scientist, current working as a data engineering. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) in Brazil, a Data Science Specialization from Johns Hopkins University, and a MBA in Behavioral Economics from ESPM in Brazil.

My research interests lie in decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular focus on financial engineering. I use data science and statistical methods as tools to better understand life and its many complexities.

In my work, I’ve applied probabilistic programming and causal inference to answer questions that traditional machine learning cannot answer. Beyond that, I’ve independently studied advanced concepts like mean field game theory to better understand and model complex behaviors in markets.

In my spare time, I like to read, enjoy a cup of coffee, write on my blog or philosophize on various aspects of life and cultures.
